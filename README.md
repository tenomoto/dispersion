# Dispersion relationships for various the atmospheric governing equations

[This Jupyter notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tenomoto/dispersion/blob/master/Dispersion.ipynb) to visualize dispersion relationships for the following systems of equations.

* fully-compressible
* unified
* pseudo-incompressible
* analastic
* quasi-hydrostatic (primitive)
